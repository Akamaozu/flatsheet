# flatsheet-editor

A multi-user, real-time editor for tabular data.

## Goal
Allow multiple users to edit tabular data in real time, and get a json file that can be downloaded or integrated with a server API.

## Early!
This is a rewrite of the editor in use at app.flatsheet.io.

It is based in part on this table-editor module: https://github.com/sethvincent/table-editor

## Support
This project is supported in part by a [code sprint grant from OpenNews](http://opennews.org/codesprints.html). More info [at the Flatsheet blog](http://flatsheet.io/blog/getting-flatsheet-to-v1-with-help-from-opennews/).
