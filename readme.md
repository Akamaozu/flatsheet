# flatsheet-editor

A multi-user, real-time editor for tabular data.

## Goal
Allow multiple users to edit tabular data in real time, and get a json file that can be downloaded or integrated with a server API.

## Early!
This is a rewrite of the editor in use at app.flatsheet.io.

It is based in part on this table-editor module: https://github.com/sethvincent/table-editor
